    """Batch generator for training speech activity detection

    Parameters
    ----------
    precomputed : `pyannote.audio.features.Precomputed`
        Precomputed features
    overlap : bool, optional
        Switch to 3 classes "non-speech vs. one speaker vs. 2+ speakers".
        Defaults to 2 classes "non-speech vs. speech".
    duration : float, optional
        Duration of sub-sequences. Defaults to 3.2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    per_epoch : float, optional
        Total audio duration per epoch, in seconds.
        Defaults to one hour (3600).
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
    optimizer : {'sgd', 'rmsprop', 'adam'}
        Defaults to 'sgd'.
    learning_rate : float, optional
        Learning rate. Defaults to 0.01.
    enable_backtrack : bool, optional
        Defaults to True.
