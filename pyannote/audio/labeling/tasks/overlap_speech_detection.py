    Parameters
    ----------
    precomputed : pyannote.audio.features.Precomputed
        Precomputed features
    duration : float, optional
        Use fixed duration segments with this `duration`.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
