        Precomputed features
    duration : float, optional

    per_epoch : float, optional
        Total audio duration per epoch, in seconds.
        Defaults to one hour (3600).
    balance: float, optional
        Artificially increase the number of positive labels by
        labeling as positive every frame in the direct neighborhood
        (less than `balance` seconds apart) of each change point.
        Defaults to 0.1 (= 100 ms).
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
