            output.

            The output of the generator must be a tuple (inputs, targets) or a
            tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights). All arrays should contain
            the same number of samples. The generator is expected to loop over
            its data indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `samples_per_epoch`
            samples have been seen by the model.
        samples_per_epoch : int
            Number of samples to process before going to the next epoch.
        nb_epoch : int
            Total number of iterations on the data
        optimizer: str, optional
            Keras optimizer. Defaults to 'rmsprop'.
        log_dir: str, optional
            When provided, log status after each epoch into this directory.

            files.
