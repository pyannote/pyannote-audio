class SpeakerChangeDetection(SegmentationTaskMixin, Task):
    """Speaker change detection

    Speaker change detection is the task of detecting speaker change points
    in a given audio recording.

    Here, it is addressed with the same approach as voice activity detection,
    except "speech" class is replaced by "change" where a frame is marked as
    "change" if a speaker change happens less than `collar` frames away.

    Note that non-speech/speech changes are not marked as speaker change.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration. Defaults to 2s.
    collar : int, optional.
        Mark frames less than `collar` frames away from actual change point as positive.
        Defaults to 1.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
