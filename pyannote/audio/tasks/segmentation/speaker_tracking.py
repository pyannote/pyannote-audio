    """Speaker tracking

    Speaker tracking is the process of determining if and when a (previously
    enrolled) person's voice can be heard in a given audio recording.

    Here, it is addressed with the same approach as voice activity detection,
    except {"non-speech", "speech"} classes are replaced by {"speaker1", ...,
    "speaker_N"} where N is the number of speakers in the training set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration. Defaults to 2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch. Defaults to 32.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
        Defaults to multiprocessing.cpu_count() // 2.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
    optimizer : callable, optional
        Callable that takes model parameters as input and returns
        an Optimizer instance. Defaults to `torch.optim.Adam`.
    learning_rate : float, optional
        Learning rate. Defaults to 1e-3.
    augmentation : BaseWaveformTransform, optional
        torch_audiomentations waveform transform, used by dataloader
        during training.
