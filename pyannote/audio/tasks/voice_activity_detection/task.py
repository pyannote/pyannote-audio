    """Voice activity detection

    Voice activity detection (or VAD) is the task of detecting speech regions
    in a given audio recording.

    It is addressed as a binary (0 or 1) sequence labeling task. A frame is
    marked as "speech" (1) as soon as at least one speaker is active.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration. Defaults to 2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
