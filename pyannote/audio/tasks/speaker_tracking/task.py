    """Speaker tracking

    Speaker tracking is the process of determining if and when a (previously
    enrolled) person's voice can be heard in a given audio recording.

    Here, it is addressed with the same approach as voice activity detection,
    except {"non-speech", "speech"} classes are replaced by {"speaker1", ...,
    "speaker_N"} where N is the number of speakers in the training set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration. Defaults to 2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
