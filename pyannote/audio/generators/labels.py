class FixedDurationSequences(YaafeMixin, FileBasedBatchGenerator):
    """(X_batch, y_batch) batch generator

    Yields batches made of sequences obtained using a sliding window over the
    coverage of the reference. Heterogeneous segments (i.e. containing more
    than one label) are skipped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extractor : YaafeFeatureExtractor
    duration: float, optional
    step: float, optional
        Duration and step of sliding window (in seconds).
        Default to 3s and 750ms.

    Returns
    -------
    X_batch : (batch_size, n_samples, n_features) numpy array
        Batch of feature sequences
    y_batch : (batch_size, ) numpy array
        Batch of corresponding labels

    Usage
    -----
    >>> batch_generator = FixedDurationSequences(feature_extractor)
    >>> for X_batch, y_batch in batch_generator.from_file(current_file):
    ...     # do something with
