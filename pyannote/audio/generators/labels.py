    Yields batches made of sequences obtained using a sliding window over the

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extractor : YaafeFeatureExtractor
    duration: float, optional
    step: float, optional
        Duration and step of sliding window (in seconds).
        Default to 3s and 750ms.

    X_batch : (batch_size, n_samples, n_features) numpy array

    y_batch : (batch_size, ) numpy array
