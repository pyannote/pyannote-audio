    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence_embedding : SequenceEmbedding
        Pre-trained sequence embedding.
    feature_extractor : YaafeFeatureExtractor
        Yaafe feature extractor
    duration : float, optional
    step : float, optional
        Sliding window duration and step (in seconds).
        Defaults to 5s window with 50% step.
    internal : int, optional
