    Parameters
    ----------

        When `str`, assumes that file already contains a corresponding key with
        precomputed scores. Defaults to "seg".

    ----------------
    onset, offset : float
        Onset/offset detection thresholds
    min_duration_on : float
        Remove speaker turn shorter than that many seconds.
    min_duration_off : float
        Fill same-speaker gaps shorter than that many seconds.
    last_active_patience : float
        Stop tracking a speaker if it has not been active for that many seconds.
        This hyper-parameter has no effect when optimizing the segmentation pipeline,
        but should be optimized when part of a larger (diarization) pipeline.
