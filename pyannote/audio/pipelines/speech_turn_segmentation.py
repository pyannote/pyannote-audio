class SpeechTurnSegmentation(Pipeline):
    """Speech turn segmentation pipeline

    Combines voice activity and speaker change detections
    to obtain speaker-homogeneous speech regions.

    This pipeline is not optimizable because the metric to use for optimization
    remains an open problem. It can only be used as a part of larger pipeline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vad_scores : Inference or str, optional
        `Inference` instance used to extract raw voice activity detection scores.
        When `str`, assumes that file already contains a corresponding key with
        precomputed scores. Defaults to "vad".
    scd_scores : Inference or str, optional
        `Inference` instance used to extract raw speaker change detection scores.
        When `str`, assumes that file already contains a corresponding key with
        precomputed scores. Defaults to "scd".

    Hyper-parameters
    ----------------
    gap_max_duration : float
        Since speaker change detection is trained to detect speaker/speaker changes
        but not speaker/non-speech changes, this pipeline considers that a speaker
        change should be added in the middle of every non-speech gap, unless the gap
        is shorter than `gap_max_duration`Â seconds AND speaker change did not
        actually detect a speaker change during the gap.
