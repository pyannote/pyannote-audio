    This pipeline is not optimizable because the metric to use for optimization
    remains an open problem. It can only be used as a part of larger pipeline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : Inference or str, optional
        `Inference` instance used to extract raw speaker change detection scores.
        When `str`, assumes that file already contains a corresponding key with
        precomputed scores. Defaults to "scd".

    ----------------
    alpha : float
        Peak detection threshold.
    min_duration : float
        Segment minimum duration.
